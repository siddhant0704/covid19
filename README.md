The following Repo contains code for Mask detection algorithm along with the Social distancing Algorithm. For the Social distaning code: Use the coco names, Yolov3 config file and download the Yolov3 weights along with the video input as both the files are too big to be uploaded. After this, you shall get the desired output.

For Mask detection we have provided the jupyter notebook used for training the model.
